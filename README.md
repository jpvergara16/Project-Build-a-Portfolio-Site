Project-Build-a-Portfolio-Site - Udacity: Front End Web Development Project - "Build a Portfolio Site"

Hello! Welcome to my first design based on the Udacity mockup for a simple portfolio. I plan on working from the basic lessons I learned when I first built this and eventually using this as the skeleton for an actual portfolio site once I finish the complete Nanodegree program. Any help tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
